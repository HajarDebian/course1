        <h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>

        <p>This is my new website, it represents my first
             task in Itrax full stack diploma.</p>

        <p>This site is created by Hajar Debian, using 
            HTML, which refers to Hypertext Markup Language.</p>

        <p>We use HTML to build and design the structure 
            of our websites, then we use more different 
            tools like CSS and JS... to complete the look and feel of our website.</p>
